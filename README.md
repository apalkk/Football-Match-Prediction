# Football-Match-Prediction
Using jupyter notebooks along with the Fifa 2022 World Cup to create a model to predict match outcomes.

## Match.ipynb
In this file, I use linear regression to predict the number of goals scored by the players in the ```number of goals team1``` column of the dataset. All the columns containing strings, such as ```date``` and ```team1```. The columns containing percentages such as ```possession team1``` have been stripped of their '%' signs and converted to strings. Using linear regression gave better results than using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification as well as Random Forest Regression. This model is mostly useless for actually predicting the outcomes of matches because the amount of data necessary for the model to run would be impossible to collect until the match has not finished. The best example of this is the use of the goals of one team in the model to predict the goals of the other. However, this method proves to be quite effective, having a root mean squared error of 3.071805667454434e-15 units with the test data (created with. ```train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state = 42)```).
